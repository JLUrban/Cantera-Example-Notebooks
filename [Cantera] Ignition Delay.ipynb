    "### Ignition Delay Time\n",
    "In this example, we go over the concept of ignition delay time, defined here as the time it takes for a combustible mixture to increase in temperature by 400 K. Different fuels display different ignition behavior depending on the temperature, pressure, and equivalence ratio. Unlike adiabatic flame temperature, chemical reactions and chemical reaction rates are relevant here; a chemical mechanism is a \"map of possible pathways\" from reactants to products. This code has been adapted from an [example reactor code](http://www.cantera.org/docs/sphinx/html/cython/examples/reactors_reactor1.html) available at the Cantera website. "

For this example, we assume an adiabatic constant pressure reactor with an ideal gas equation of state.\n",

After that, we specify some variables to keep track of `igReactorNetwork` and species mole fractions as we advance the simulation time. We initialize `time` at `0.0` seconds and specify the maximum number of steps we want the simulation to take with `numSteps`. Then we initialize the variables `times` and `data` to keep track of the simulation time, temperature, and select species concentrations for all of these steps. Lastly, we initialize the variable where ignition delay time will be stored, `tIgn` as zero. "

Every timestep, we check to see if the reactor temperature has increased by 400 K. If it has, we change the assignment of `tIgn` to a value other than zero.
